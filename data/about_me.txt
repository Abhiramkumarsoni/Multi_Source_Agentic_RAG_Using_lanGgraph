My name is Abhiram Soni from Chatra Jharkhand India. i am  data scientist and Agentic ai engineer inthuiast with a strong academic foundation and a deep passion for solving real-world problems through data-driven solutions.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science, specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from Wolf University in collaboration with AlmaBetter Innoversity.

My background in mathematics has developed my analytical thinking, which I now apply across various domains using machine learning and AI techniques. I’ve worked on several impactful projects, including:

WebBased Interactive Agent

Fraud Detection using machine learning algorithms

Recommendation Systems based on user behavior

Hotel Booking Analysis using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau

Sky Analytics with Excel dashboards

Healthcare Data Analysis using a dynamic Power BI dashboard

These projects allowed me to combine statistical insights with practical implementation using tools like Python, SQL, and popular ML frameworks.

Additionally, I developed a web-based interactive AI agent that allows users to ask questions via a shared URL and receive real-time responses. This project enhanced my skills in building intelligent, user-centric applications and deploying them effectively on the web.

Outside the tech space, I’m passionate about cricket and chess. Cricket has taught me discipline and teamwork, while chess helps sharpen my strategic and logical thinking — both qualities that support my problem-solving approach in data science.

I’m excited to continue learning, contribute to innovative projects, and grow as a professional in the field of Data Science and AI.
